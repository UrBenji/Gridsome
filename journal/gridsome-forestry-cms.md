#### Use Forestry as a CMS for Gridsome

[105COLLECTIVE](https://www.105collective.uk/) IS A GROUP OF UK-BASED ARTISTS BRINGING THEIR WORK TO THE DIGITAL, VR, AND CRYPTO SPACES. THE GROUP CONVENED IN MARCH 2020 DURING THE FIRST WEEKS OF THE COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC, SEEKING WAYS TO SHARE ART IN A FORMAT ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AUDIENCES ON NOVEL SHARED-REALITY FORMATS, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ALLOWING FOR THE PROSPECT OF LONG-TERM ISOLATION DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING .

Forestry UI was designed by **Nichlas W. Andersen**.

You can import this starter to Forestry and start editing and creating posts or projects right away.

Forestry also comes with instant previews, for you to preview your content before publishing.

When you save content in **Forestry**, it's commited back to your Git repository. If you link your repository to a service like **Netlify** or **Next**, on every push, your site will be deployed over to a CDN network.

Enjoy the best development and user experience! ðŸš€
